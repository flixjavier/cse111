From May 27
to Jun 1 2024   18      Construct the AGROAVE.py file, where I use Tkinder to build a form where we gather 
                        all the necessary information to export Onions into USA. In this file I develop the main(), populate_main_window(), and some nested functions like Submit_info(), clear_entries(). During this week the program works gathering the information and appending all the information into a CSV file. 
                        At the end of the week I create a second File "buscar_remision_AGROAVE.py", where this program help me to find the correct information inside the CSV. and Also display the data. 
From Jun 1
to Jun 3 2024      4    I create the test file and fix or
                        add some other characteristics to the AGROAVE file. For example I add a weigth calculator that is helpful when submiting the information. 
                        I tested some functions but the nested functios where outside of my scope. 
                        Finally I added error handling code. 
                        All the code Passed all 4 test.  

NOTE: The program is writen in spanish, because the intention is to be used for others members of the team. I added comments to explain what every function do.
